# Codebase analysis — splurge-safe-io

Date: 2025-10-08

This document reviews the `splurge_safe_io` package for logic, architecture, design, simplicity, and maintainability. It summarizes findings, strengths, issues, and prioritized recommendations.

## What I reviewed

- `pyproject.toml`
- `splurge_safe_io/constants.py`
- `splurge_safe_io/exceptions.py`
- `splurge_safe_io/path_validator.py`
- `splurge_safe_io/safe_text_file_reader.py`
- `splurge_safe_io/safe_text_file_writer.py`
- `splurge_safe_io/__init__.py` (empty module)

## High-level summary

The package provides small, focused utilities for safe reading and writing of text files with deterministic newline normalization and path validation to reduce security risks (path traversal, dangerous characters, etc.). The design favors explicit error handling by converting built-in exceptions into a package-specific exception hierarchy, which is a strong choice for library clarity and consumer ergonomics.

Overall the code is readable and organized. The API is small and purposeful. The following sections list strengths, issues, and recommended changes prioritized by impact and risk.

## Strengths

- Small, focused modules with single responsibilities (validation, reading, writing, constants, exceptions).
- Clear, descriptive exception hierarchy that makes it easy for callers to catch specific error classes.
- Explicit decoding/encoding handling to avoid platform newline translation and hidden Unicode errors.
- Good docstrings and comments explaining intent and error mapping.
- Path validation covers many common attack vectors: NUL/control characters, traversal tokens, colon handling for Windows, and base-directory restriction.
- Writer/reader normalize newlines consistently and expose both full-read and streaming APIs.

## Issues and opportunities

I list issues grouped by severity and then provide concrete suggestions.

### 2) Path traversal checks can be both too-strict and brittle (medium)
- Checking strings for `..`, repeated separators, and `~` as a blanket policy can falsely reject valid inputs (e.g., filenames containing `..` or Windows paths that contain `\\` legitimately). The code tries to special-case Windows drive letters for colons but still may incorrectly flag legitimate absolute Windows paths.
- Using regex-based checks on the raw string before resolving symlinks or combining with base_directory is brittle and can create false positives.

Recommendation: Rely primarily on Path.resolve()/relative_to checks for canonical containment when a `base_directory` is provided. Keep lightweight string sanity checks (NULs and control chars) but avoid rejecting `..` or repeated separators before path resolution. Add unit tests covering common Windows paths, UNC paths, and intentionally odd-but-valid names.

### 3) PathValidator.validate_path API assumptions (low)
- `validate_path` accepts `allow_relative` but if False it only checks `path.is_absolute()` on the Path object created from the input. Because resolution is performed later against `base_directory`, this is OK, but the semantics could be clarified: should relative paths be allowed when `base_directory` is provided? Currently yes (they are resolved relative to base_directory). Document this clearly.

Recommendation: Clarify `allow_relative` vs `base_directory` semantics in the docstring, and consider renaming to `allow_relative_input` if you want to be strict about the input type.

### 4) Reader streaming inefficiency (low)
- `SafeTextFileReader.read_as_stream` currently reads the entire file into memory via `self.read()` then yields chunks. This defeats the purpose of streaming for large files.

Recommendation: Implement a true streaming reader that reads bytes/chunks from disk, decodes incrementally (use `codecs.getincrementaldecoder`), does newline normalization across chunk boundaries, and yields lists of lines. This is more work but necessary for large file support.

### 7) Tests and CI (process)
- `pyproject.toml` lists `pytest` and `mypy`, but repo doesn't include tests (beyond possibly `tests/` folder) or CI config demonstrated here.

Recommendation: Add unit tests for edge cases (Windows path patterns, encoding errors, streaming large files) and a simple GitHub Actions CI pipeline to run lint/test/mypy.

### 8) Missing __all__ and package export controls (low)
- `__init__.py` is empty. Consider exporting public API (e.g., `SafeTextFileReader`, `SafeTextFileWriter`, `PathValidator`) or leaving empty intentionally; document in README.

Recommendation: Add a minimal `__all__` or import public symbols for convenience.

## Small bugs and code nitpicks

- In `safe_text_file_reader._read`, both `OSError` and `IOError` are caught; on modern Python `IOError` is an alias of `OSError`. You can simplify error handling to avoid duplication.
- In `path_validator._DANGEROUS_CHARS`, many control characters are enumerated; consider using a programmatic range check (ord < 32) to simplify maintenance.
- In `safe_text_file_writer.open_safe_text_writer`, `file_path` may be a `Path` already; passing `Path(file_path)` is harmless but inconsistent with other modules.
- In `safe_text_file_writer._open`, `open()` is used not via `self._file_path.open()` — that's fine but inconsistent; consider using `Path.open()` for symmetry.

## Prioritized actionable changes

1. Harden and simplify `PathValidator` (medium priority).
   - Remove brittle regex checks for `..` and repeated separators; keep NUL/control-char checks.
   - Ensure Windows/UNC path tests are added.

2. Implement streaming read without full materialization (medium priority).
   - Use incremental decoding and boundary-preserving newline normalization.

3. Add unit tests and CI (medium priority).
   - Add tests for path validation, reader/writer error mapping, and streaming behavior.

4. Document public API in `__init__.py` and README (low priority).

## Suggested follow-ups (non-blocking)

- Provide a small performance benchmark comparing streaming vs full-read for large files.
- Consider adding an async API variant for read/write to support modern async tooling.
- Consider exposing small helper functions for common CSV-like workflows (preview headers, sniff delimiter) but keep them out of core safety primitives.

If you want, I can open a PR that: fixes the duplicate exception, removes unused imports, and adds a focused unit test around `PathValidator` Windows path behavior. Which would you like me to do next?
