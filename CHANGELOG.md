## Changelog

### [2025.0.6] - 2025-10-14

#### Added
- New methods `SafeTextFileReader.readlines()` and `SafeTextFileReader.readlines_as_stream()` to provide clearer API naming that matches Python's standard `file.readlines()` semantics.

#### Changed
- `SafeTextFileReader.read()` and `SafeTextFileReader.read_as_stream()` are now deprecated and will be removed in version 2025.1.0. Use `readlines()` and `readlines_as_stream()` instead.
- Updated documentation and examples to use the new preferred method names.
- In version 2025.1.0, `read()` will be repurposed to return the raw file content as a single string (matching Python's `file.read()` semantics).


### [2025.0.5] - 2025-10-13

#### Added
- Support for `skip_empty_lines` parameter in `SafeTextFileReader` to filter out whitespace-only lines during read operations.
- New unit tests to cover the behavior of `skip_empty_lines` in various methods (`read()`, `read_as_stream()`, `preview()`, and `line_count()`).
- Updated documentation in `docs/api/API-REFERENCE.md` to include `skip_empty_lines` parameter details and examples.

#### Documentation
- Added a short usage example to `docs/README-DETAILS.md` demonstrating `skip_empty_lines=True` with `read_as_stream()` and `preview()`.



### [2025.0.4] - 2025-10-10

#### Added
- `SafeTextFileReader.line_count()` â€” a memory-efficient helper to count logical lines. Uses a size threshold (default 64 MiB) to pick between a single full decode (small files) and the streaming reader (large files). The method intentionally ignores `skip_header_lines` and `skip_footer_lines` and validates that `threshold_bytes >= 1 MiB`.

#### Added / Changed
- Added and updated unit tests to cover `line_count()` behaviors for small and large files.
- Replaced fragile direct attribute assignment patterns in tests (for example, `Path.stat = ...`) with `monkeypatch.setattr(...)` to make tests robust and isolated.
- Resolved small lint and typing issues surfaced by `ruff` and `mypy` during development.


### [2025.0.3] - 2025-10-10
#### Changed
- `SafeTextFileReader.preview()` now uses the streaming reader internally and will stop reading as soon as the requested number of preview lines are available for most encodings. Encodings that cannot be decoded incrementally (for example certain UTF-16 variants without a BOM) still fall back to a full read.
- Default and minimum buffer sizes were increased to improve streaming throughput and reduce syscall overhead: `DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE` is now 32768 bytes and `MIN_BUFFER_SIZE` is now 16384 bytes.
- Default preview length changed from 100 to 25 lines (`DEFAULT_PREVIEW_LINES = 25`).

#### Added
- Unit tests covering preview streaming behavior, header/footer skipping in previews, encoding-fallback behavior, and ensuring the reader releases OS file handles when preview returns early.

#### Fixed
- Small lint/type issues surfaced by `ruff` and `mypy` were resolved.
- Updated docstrings and API reference to reflect the new defaults and streaming preview behavior.


### [2025.0.2] - 2025-10-09
#### Fixed
- Addressed an issue with buffer size calculation in `SafeTextFileReader` that could lead to incorrect line splitting. This fix prevents the reader from yielding empty string artifacts when reading files in chunks, ensuring that only actual lines from the source file are returned.
- Added unit tests to cover edge cases related to chunk boundaries and line splitting to prevent regression.


### [2025.0.1] - 2025-10-09
#### Changed
- Bump package version to `2025.0.1` in `pyproject.toml` and expose `__version__ = "2025.0.1"` in `splurge_safe_io/__init__.py`.
- `splurge_safe_io/__init__.py` now explicitly imports and re-exports package exception classes (removed any wildcard exception import) and tidied the public exports.
- `SafeTextFileReader` (`splurge_safe_io/safe_text_file_reader.py`):
    - Default for `strip` is now False.
    - Added a `buffer_size` constructor parameter and read-only `buffer_size` property (uses `DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`/`MIN_BUFFER_SIZE` from constants).
    - Enforce a minimum raw-read buffer size using `MIN_BUFFER_SIZE`.
    - Fixed streaming implementation to use `buffer_size` for raw byte reads (previous behavior used the logical `chunk_size`).
    - Improved Google-style docstrings and added usage examples to clarify tuning `buffer_size` vs `chunk_size`.


### [2025.0.0] - 2025-10-08
#### Added
- Initial release of splurge-safe-io package with:
    - SafeTextFileReader and SafeTextFileWriter for deterministic text file I/O with LF normalization.
    - PathValidator for secure path validation against traversal and dangerous characters.
    - Clear exception hierarchy mapping common I/O errors to package-specific exceptions.
